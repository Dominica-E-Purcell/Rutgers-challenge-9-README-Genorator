# <Rutgers-challenge-9-README-Genorator>

## Description


My motiviation for this project was simplify and streamline the process of generating a README.md for a github repository. I wanted to create a project that helped break down making a README into simple individual steps, to help with mental originizatio. I have found that being able to articulate each prompt individually has been an important step in distilling the essence of a project that I have worked on. I have learned about different sections of a project call on each other to create a simple but dynamic interative experience.
